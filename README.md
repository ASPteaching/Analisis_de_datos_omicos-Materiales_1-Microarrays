# Omics_Data_Analysis-Course_Materials

This repository contains R code and materials for my -never published- book on Microarray Data Analysis.

It will be progressively filled with 

- R scripts for those chapters where there is R code
- Rmarkdown files to generate the book

The book is almost ten years old, what, in this field, means it is probably outdated. 

- The first thing I will do is to update the scripts so that they work with 2019's Bioconductor. 
- After this I will re-write the old .rnw (Sweave) files and create a bookdown document.
